# HardGAN: A Haze-Aware Representation Distillation GAN for Single Image Dehazing

## News

[2020/11/05] Our code released.

## Reuqirements

Pytorch >= 1.1.0

numpy >=  1.6.0

tensorboardX

## Quick start

+ `mkdir checkpoint data NH_results training_log`
+ Download datasets into ./data folder
+ Use `bash run.sh`
+ If you train on RESIDE datasets, please use train_phrase 1.
+ If you train on NTIRE2020ï¼Œ please train train_phrase 1 first. Then, copy trained trained parameter to G1 and G2(crop_size is [240, 240]).  Finetune G2.  Train G3 finally(crop_size is [960, 960]). You can choose whether to do data augmentation by aug_fog.py.
